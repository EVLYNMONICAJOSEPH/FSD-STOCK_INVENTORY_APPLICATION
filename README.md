# FSD-STOCK_INVENTORY_APPLICATION
Controlling a company's product inventory is an activity that demands a lot of attention. One of the ways to ensure efficient inventory tracking is through the use of management software that proposes to take stock inventory
The technology helps a lot to keep the inventory organized, avoid problems with the lack of products needed for sale, and control the excess of idle goods, which can compromise the business' working capital. Even better are the systems that offer the inventory control module integrated with other sectors, such as:

1.Direct Sales
2.Purchase of Products
3.Financial Control
The management tool automates taking inventory of the company's stock, facilitating the day-to-day work and increasing productivity. Employees can use the time that they previously applied to check the stock to perform other more important functions. However, even with all the technology available, the entry and exit of products must be monitored to prevent fraud, theft, and damage.
